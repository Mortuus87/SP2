# E-commerce site

![image](Screenshot%202022-11-20%20133931.png)

This was my second semester project submitted to my frontend studies at Noroff.

## Description

The site uses the strapi headless CMS to manage a catalog of products, as well as some less advanced content serving.

## Built With
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [strapi](https://strapi.io/)

## Getting Started

Download this site by cloning the repo, or downloading the zip and extracting it.

### 1. Installing the Strapi API

The Strapi project can be found [here](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2). You will need it to utilize the dynamic content on the site.

You can clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2.git), or download it as a zip and extract it manually.

No matter your choice you will need to install the strapi instance. So navigate to where you downloaded it, and run the following:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run develop
```

### 2. Apply changes to the site

The site comes with pre-compiled css, but if you wish to apply any changes to the styling you will need to compile the scss:

Navigate to the site directory and run:
```
npm install
```
When the packages are downloaded, run:

```bash
npm run watch
```
This should compile any changes done to the scss-files
